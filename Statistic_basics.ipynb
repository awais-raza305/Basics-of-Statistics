        "\n",
        "Nominal: Categories without order (e.g., blood type: A, B, AB, O).\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinal: Categories with a meaningful order (e.g., survey ratings: Poor, Fair, Good).\n",
        "\n",
        "Interval: Numerical scale with equal intervals but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).\n",
        "\n",
        "Ratio: Interval scale with a true zero point (e.g., weight, height).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Measures of Central Tendency\n",
        "Mean: Average of data. Use when data is symmetric and no extreme outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median: Middle value. Use when data is skewed or has outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mode: Most frequent value. Useful for categorical data or to find the most common item.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. Concept of Dispersion; Variance and Standard Deviation\n",
        "Dispersion: Measures the spread or variability in data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variance: Average of squared differences from the mean; indicates spread.\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard Deviation: Square root of variance; expressed in same units as data; easier to interpret.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is a Box Plot?\n",
        "A graphical summary of data showing median, quartiles, and potential outliers.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q5. Role of Random Sampling\n",
        "Ensures each member of a population has an equal chance of selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Helps produce unbiased samples that represent the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Allows valid inferences and generalizations about the whole population.\n",

        "Effect: Skewness affects the choice of statistical methods and interpretation, especially mean and median.\n",

        "IQR: Difference between Q3 (75th percentile) and Q1 (25th percentile).\n",
        "\n",
        "Use: Identifies spread of middle 50% of data; detects outliers if data points lie beyond 1.5 × IQR above Q3 or below Q1.\n",

        "Fixed number of trials (n).\n",
